# UWF
When setting up a simple UWF computer lab environment with Windows 10, I found the lack of web resources explaining the "how to" very lacking. I first would like to say, I'm not a script writer and am mostly posting this so I can remember what I did for the future. Credits to the internet and the URL(s) below. I pieced together what I needed to get the job done
Scripts and Processes for UWF in Windows 10 LTSB

See wiki for more info.
